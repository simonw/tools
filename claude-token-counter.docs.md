This page provides a tool for counting tokens used by Claude models, which is useful for understanding API costs and optimizing prompts. Users can enter system prompts and user messages, optionally attach images or PDF documents, and receive a detailed token count breakdown from Anthropic's API. The tool stores the API key locally in the browser for convenience and supports drag-and-drop file uploads for efficient workflows.
