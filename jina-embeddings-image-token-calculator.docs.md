Calculate the token cost for images used in API requests by uploading or dragging an image file into the tool. The calculator analyzes the image dimensions and divides them into 224-pixel tiles, multiplying the total tile count by 1,000 to determine the token expense. This helps estimate costs when working with vision-based APIs that charge per image token.
