Play a classic Minesweeper game directly in your browser with support for three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Use left-click to reveal cells and right-click to place flags, or toggle between reveal and flag modes on mobile with long-press support. The game features a timer to track your speed, mine counter to monitor remaining flags, and immediate visual feedback when you win or hit a mine.
