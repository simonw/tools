Use the Gemini API to analyze images and generate segmentation masks with visual overlays. Upload an image and provide a prompt describing what you want to segment, then the application displays bounding boxes and mask visualizations directly on the image canvas. Token usage metrics are provided for each API call, and you can choose from various Gemini model versions including thinking and non-thinking variants.
