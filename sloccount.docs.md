# Documentation

Count lines of code in source files across multiple programming languages using SLOCCount algorithms compiled to WebAssembly. This tool analyzes code from pasted snippets, GitHub repositories, or uploaded ZIP files, providing detailed breakdowns by language along with COCOMO-based effort and cost estimates. The analysis runs entirely in your browser using the actual SLOCCount Perl scripts and C-based counters compiled to WebAssembly for fast, privacy-preserving processing.
