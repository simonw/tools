Count lines of code in software projects by uploading files, pasting code snippets, or analyzing public GitHub repositories using the classic SLOCCount algorithm compiled to WebAssembly. The tool analyzes code in multiple programming languages and provides detailed breakdowns by language along with cost and effort estimates based on the COCOMO software engineering model. Customize the salary and overhead multipliers to adjust the estimates based on your specific context.
