Count source code lines using this analyzer that implements the SLOCCount algorithm via WebAssembly and Perl. Analyze code by pasting it directly, providing a GitHub repository URL, or uploading a ZIP file containing your source code. The tool automatically detects programming languages and provides estimates of development effort and cost using the COCOMO model.
