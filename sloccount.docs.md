SLOCCount is a tool that analyzes source code to count physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC). Users can analyze code by pasting it directly into the text area with a filename for language detection, or by providing a GitHub repository URL. The tool displays total line count, number of languages, files analyzed, and provides a detailed breakdown of lines per language with percentages.
