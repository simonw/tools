Determine whether an image contains a bird using OpenAI's CLIP model running entirely in your browser. Upload an image by dragging and dropping, pasting from your clipboard, or selecting a file, and the tool will analyze it against multiple candidate labels to classify whether it depicts a bird. The application also supports real-time webcam analysis with pinch-to-zoom controls and camera switching on mobile devices.
