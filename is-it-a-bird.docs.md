Detect whether images contain birds using OpenAI's CLIP model, powered by Transformers.js running entirely in your browser. The tool analyzes uploaded, pasted, or dragged images and classifies them against candidate labels including bird, animal, object, person, and landscape, using a 0.5 confidence threshold to make its determination. No images are sent to any server—all processing happens locally on your device.
