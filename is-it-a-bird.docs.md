Classify images to determine if they contain a bird using OpenAI's CLIP model running entirely in your browser. Upload an image via drag-and-drop, paste, or file selection, or use your webcam for real-time analysis with pinch-to-zoom support. The model downloads locally (~150 MB) on first use and no images are sent to any server.
