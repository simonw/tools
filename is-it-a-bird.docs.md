Determine whether an image contains a bird using OpenAI's CLIP model running entirely in your browser with Transformers.js. Upload an image by dragging, pasting, or selecting a file, or use your device's webcam for real-time bird detection analysis. The tool processes all images locally without sending any data to external servers, and displays confidence scores across five categories: bird, animal, object, person, and landscape.
