Parse and analyze HTML documents using JustHTML, a pure Python HTML5 parser that runs directly in your browser via Pyodide. This playground provides multiple modes for working with HTML: query elements using CSS selectors, pretty-print formatted output, visualize the document tree structure, and stream parsing events as they occur. Load HTML by pasting directly or fetching from CORS-enabled URLs, then explore the parsed document with real-time results.
