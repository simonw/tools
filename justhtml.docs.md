Parse and analyze HTML documents using JustHTML, a pure Python HTML5 parser that implements the official WHATWG specification and passes all 9,200+ html5lib tests. The playground provides multiple modes to query HTML with CSS selectors, pretty-print documents, visualize tree structures, and observe streaming parse events through an interactive web interface. Load HTML by pasting directly or fetching from CORS-enabled URLs, then explore the parsed content with no external dependencies required.
