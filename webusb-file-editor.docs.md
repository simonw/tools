The MicroPython File Editor is a browser-based file manager for MicroPython and CircuitPython devices connected via Web Serial. Connect to your device to browse directories, view and edit files in a dual-pane interface, and manage your device's filesystem directly from the browser. The tool uses the raw REPL protocol to execute Python commands for listing, reading, writing, and deleting files. Features include directory navigation, real-time modification tracking, unsaved changes warnings, file download capability, and support for creating new files. Requires a Chromium-based browser with Web Serial API support.
