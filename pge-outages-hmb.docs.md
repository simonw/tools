Track power outages across the Half Moon Bay area with this interactive map that displays real-time PG&E outage data within a 15-mile radius. The map visualizes both individual outage points and affected geographic areas, providing detailed information such as customer impact, estimated restoration times, and outage causes for each incident. Custom location markers can be added by passing a data URL in the page hash, allowing users to overlay additional points of interest on the outage map.
