Remove EXIF data, GPS location, camera information, and other metadata from images using proper lossless techniques. For JPEG files, uses piexifjs to strip EXIF data without re-encoding. For PNG files, implements chunk filtering to remove metadata chunks (tEXt, iTXt, zTXt, eXIf, tIME) while preserving image data intact. Other formats fall back to canvas re-encoding. Shows whether each image was processed losslessly or re-encoded. All processing happens locally in your browser with no server uploads.
