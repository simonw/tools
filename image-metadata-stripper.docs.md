Remove EXIF data, GPS location, camera information, and other metadata from images entirely in your browser. Drag and drop or select images to strip all metadata - the tool re-encodes images through an HTML canvas which preserves only pixel data. Supports JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, and BMP with options to change output format and quality. All processing happens locally with no server uploads, making it safe for sensitive photos.
