This page demonstrates different UI layout patterns for browsing collections of tools or components. It showcases three distinct viewing options: Compact View with hover tooltips, Card View with expanded descriptions, and Table View with a structured format. The demo includes interactive elements like collapsible sections that can be toggled open or closed, a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes, and view-switching controls that persist your preference. Each layout pattern is fully implemented with CSS and JavaScript, making this a useful reference for implementing similar interfaces in your own projects. The demo also includes an alphabetical tool index in a collapsible grid format that provides quick access to all items.
