This tool converts GitHub issues to markdown format by fetching the issue data and all associated comments from the GitHub API. Users can optionally provide a personal access token to access private repositories and increase rate limits, with the token being securely stored in browser local storage. The converted markdown output can be easily copied to the clipboard for use in documentation, backups, or other purposes.
