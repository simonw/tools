This tool converts GitHub issues to markdown format by fetching the issue data and all associated comments from the GitHub API. Users can optionally provide a personal access token to access private repositories and increase API rate limits, which is stored locally in the browser for convenience. The tool also automatically expands any GitHub code blob URLs found in the issue or comments with their actual code snippets, formatted as syntax-highlighted code blocks.
