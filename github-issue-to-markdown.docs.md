This tool converts GitHub issues into markdown format by fetching the issue details and all associated comments from the GitHub API. It supports optional authentication via personal access tokens for accessing private repositories and increasing rate limits, storing the token securely in browser local storage. The converter automatically expands inline GitHub code links with syntax-highlighted code snippets extracted from the repository.
