  "description": "Explore an interactive CSS grid layout that demonstrates dynamic element expansion with smooth animations. Click the green cell labeled \"1x2\" to trigger a symmetric animation that expands the element to fill the entire grid container, then click again to animate it back to its original position. The layout combines CSS Grid positioning with JavaScript event handling to create a polished visual effect that smoothly transitions between states.",
