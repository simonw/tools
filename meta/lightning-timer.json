  "description": "Track time with Lightning Timer, a full-screen countdown application that displays elapsed seconds in large, easy-to-read format. Click the timer display to start, pause, or reset the countdown, and access the settings icon to configure the total duration and optional warning threshold that triggers a visual color change. The timer supports URL-based configuration for quick setup and displays the remaining time in both the page and browser title bar.",
