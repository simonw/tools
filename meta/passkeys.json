  "description": "Experiment with passkey registration and authentication using the WebAuthn API in your browser. This demo allows you to create passkey credentials, authenticate with them, and inspect the underlying protocol responses and data. Stored credentials are maintained locally in your browser's storage, making this a fully client-side implementation for learning how modern passwordless authentication works.",
