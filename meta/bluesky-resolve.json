  "description": "View and resolve Bluesky handles to their corresponding Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) using the AT Protocol API. Enter a Bluesky handle in the format `username.bsky.social` to retrieve the associated DID, which serves as a unique identifier for accounts on the Bluesky network. This tool provides a simple interface for looking up handle-to-DID mappings through Bluesky's public resolver endpoint.",
