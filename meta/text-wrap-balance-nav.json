  "description": "Explore how the CSS `text-wrap: balance` property affects navigation layout and text distribution across multiple lines. This interactive demonstration allows you to toggle the text-wrap balance feature on and off while adjusting the number of visible navigation items to see how the browser distributes text more evenly across lines. Use the slider and checkbox controls to observe the differences in how links wrap and align within the constrained navigation container.",
