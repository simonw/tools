The demo showcases three different approaches for rendering large numbers of points\u2014scaled markers, custom HTML elements, and GeoJSON circle layers\u2014with the map automatically adjusted to fit all markers in view. Users can interact with the tilted 3D map to navigate and explore the marker distribution across the San Francisco area.",
