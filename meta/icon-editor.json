  "description": "Create and edit 24\u00d724 pixel icons with an intuitive browser-based editor featuring a live grid canvas, color picker, and emoji starter templates. Design your icons by clicking pixels directly on the canvas, customize colors using the preset palette or custom hex input, and optionally start with common emojis or custom characters that are automatically converted to pixelated artwork. Your work is automatically saved to the URL, allowing you to bookmark or share your designs without any backend storage requirements, and you can download your finished icon as a PNG file when complete.",
