Set a goal for each session, choose from preset time intervals ranging from 5 to 60 minutes, and pause or resume as needed while the timer counts down. All session data including start times, end times, and pause history is automatically saved and displayed in a detailed log table, with the ability to export the data as JSON for further analysis or record-keeping.",
