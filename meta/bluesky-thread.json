  "description": "View Bluesky thread conversations with nested reply hierarchies and chronological sorting options. This viewer fetches posts from public Bluesky APIs and displays them with color-coded depth levels, embedded media support, and interactive features like quoted post previews and image galleries. Users can toggle between thread view (showing reply nesting) and chronological view (most recent first), with the ability to hide non-author replies in thread mode for easier navigation through long conversations.",
