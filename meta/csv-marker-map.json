  "description": "View CSV data as markers on an interactive map using the `?csv=URL` parameter to specify a CSV file containing latitude and longitude columns. The map supports additional customization through query parameters including `center` to set the initial location, `zoom` for zoom level, `color` to change marker color, and `marker` to add individual points. Map position and zoom level are automatically saved to the URL bar as you navigate, allowing you to share your current view with others.",
