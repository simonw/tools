The `<markdown-copy>` web component renders markdown content with built-in controls for copying and viewing the source code. Users can toggle between the rendered markdown view and the raw markdown syntax using the menu button in the top-right corner, or copy the entire markdown text to their clipboard with a single click. The component automatically handles markdown formatting including headings, code blocks, tables, blockquotes, and lists.
