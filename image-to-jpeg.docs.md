Compress and optimize image files by uploading them to this web-based tool that applies adjustable JPEG quality settings to reduce file size. The interface allows users to compare the original and optimized versions side-by-side by toggling between views or pressing and holding the image, while providing real-time compression statistics and the ability to download the optimized file or copy its data URI for embedding in code.
