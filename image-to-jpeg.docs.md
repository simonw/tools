The Image Optimizer allows you to compress and optimize your images by adjusting JPEG quality settings. Upload an image by clicking the dropzone or using drag-and-drop, then adjust the quality slider to reduce file size while maintaining appropriate visual quality. Toggle between original and optimized versions to compare quality, and download or copy the data URI of your optimized image when satisfied with the results.
