# tools.simonwillison.net

Miscellaneous HTML+JavaScript tools I have built, almost all with the assistance of LLMs.

This collection is partly **an experiment** in how much it's possible to get done through prompting alone, against projects with extremely low stakes. 

The **[colophon](https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon)** includes links to the prompts and chat transcripts I used to create and iterate on each of these tools.

The code lives in [simonw/tools](https://github.com/simonw/tools). Most of these used a version of the Claude custom instructions [described here](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/19/one-shot-python-tools/#custom-instructions).

## Local Browsing

To browse these tools locally without setting up a server:

```bash
# Install dependencies and build the local index
uv run --no-project --with markdown ./build_local_index.py

# Or using pip
pip install markdown
python build_local_index.py
```

Then open `index.html` in your browser to explore all tools. This creates:

1. `index.html` - A searchable index of all tools with descriptions
2. `colophon.html` - Development history with links to LLM transcripts (if it doesn't already exist)

The local index provides:

- Search functionality to find tools by name or description
- Sorting by name or recent update date
- Direct links to open tools in your browser
- Tool descriptions from `.docs.md` files
