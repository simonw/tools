Execute Python code directly in your browser using a WebAssembly-based MicroPython environment with support for the standard library, async/await, and JavaScript interop via the `fetch()` function. Code is automatically saved in the URL hash for easy sharing and persistence across browser sessions. The interface includes example snippets, real-time output capture, execution timing, and a built-in test suite to verify runtime functionality.
