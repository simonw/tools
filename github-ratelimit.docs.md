This tool allows users to authenticate with GitHub and monitor their API rate limits across different resource types. The application securely stores a GitHub token in local storage, retrieves rate limit data from the GitHub API, and displays it in an interactive dashboard with visual progress bars indicating usage levels. Rate limit information includes remaining calls, reset times, and warnings when usage approaches critical thresholds.
