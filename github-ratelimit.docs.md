This page provides a GitHub API rate limit monitoring tool that displays current usage across different API resource categories. Users authenticate with GitHub through a popup window and can then check their remaining API calls, which are visualized with color-coded progress bars indicating usage levels. The tool tracks limits for different resource types (like core, search, and graphql) and shows reset times, helping developers manage their API consumption effectively.
