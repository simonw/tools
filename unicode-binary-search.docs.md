Explore Unicode characters through interactive binary search visualization. This tool fetches character metadata from a remote database using HTTP Range requests, allowing you to search for any Unicode character and see exactly which network requests were made at each step of the search algorithm. Each query demonstrates how binary search efficiently narrows down results while minimizing data transfer.
