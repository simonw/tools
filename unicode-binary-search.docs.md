Search for Unicode characters and watch a binary search algorithm execute over HTTP in real time. Each search step fetches only the specific byte range needed from a Unicode database file using HTTP Range requests, visualizing how binary search minimizes data transfer. The network log displays every step of the algorithm, showing cached signpost lookups and fetched records with response times, along with a summary of total requests and bytes transferred.
