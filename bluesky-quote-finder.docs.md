This page is a Bluesky Quote Finder tool that allows users to discover all quote posts of a given Bluesky post. Users input a post URL, and the application fetches the original post details along with all quotes, displaying them with color-coded depth indicators and sortable views (by likes, recency, or oldest first). The tool integrates with Bluesky's public API to retrieve post data and supports URL parameter sharing for easy navigation.
