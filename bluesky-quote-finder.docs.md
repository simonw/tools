This Bluesky Quote Finder application allows users to discover all quote posts of a given Bluesky post by inputting its URL. The tool fetches the original post details and retrieves all quotes through the Bluesky public API, displaying them with metadata including author information, engagement statistics, and creation dates. Users can sort results by most likes, most recent, or oldest first, with the view preference and post URL persisted through URL parameters for easy sharing.
