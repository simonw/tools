This page provides an interactive tool for testing CORS-enabled fetch requests directly in the browser. Users can enter a URL and send a GET request to inspect the response status, headers (limited to those exposed by CORS), and response body in a formatted interface. The tool automatically normalizes URLs by adding `https://` if no scheme is provided, validates the input, and displays detailed error messages when requests fail due to CORS restrictions or network issues, making it useful for debugging API connectivity and CORS configuration problems.
