# Documentation

This page provides an interactive tool for testing HTTP requests and inspecting CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) behavior in the browser. Users can construct requests with custom methods, headers, and body content, then send them to any URL to see which headers and response data the browser permits access to based on CORS policies. The tool includes a curl command importer for quickly converting existing curl requests, stores request state in the URL fragment for easy sharing, and displays detailed information about response status, headers, and body content while clearly indicating when the browser blocks access due to CORS restrictions.
