Test HTTP requests directly from your browser and inspect what response data CORS rules allow you to access. This tool lets you configure custom headers, request bodies, and HTTP methods while showing exactly which response headers and data the browser permits you to read. It's useful for debugging CORS issues, testing API endpoints, and understanding how browser security policies affect your requests.
