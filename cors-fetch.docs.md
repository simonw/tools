Test HTTP requests directly in your browser and observe which response headers and body content are accessible through CORS restrictions. This tool allows you to customize request methods, headers, and body data, then displays the server's response along with any CORS-related limitations that may block access to certain information. You can also import requests from curl commands to quickly set up complex queries.
