Test HTTP requests directly in your browser and inspect the response headers and body that CORS restrictions allow you to access. This tool supports custom headers, request bodies in JSON or form-encoded formats, and includes a curl command importer for quickly setting up requests. The application uses shareable URL fragments to save your request configuration for later use.
