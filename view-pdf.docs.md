View PDF documents directly in your browser with this lightweight viewer that supports navigation, zooming, and automatic scaling. Load PDFs by entering a URL or passing one via the `?url=` parameter, with support for CORS-enabled PDF sources. The viewer renders all pages with customizable zoom levels from 50% to 200%, and automatically tracks your position as you scroll through the document.
