Make Colors Transparent in PNG is an interactive tool that allows you to remove specific colors from images and export the result with transparent backgrounds. Upload or paste an image, click on any color to select it for transparency, and adjust the tolerance slider to control how many similar colors are removed. Download your processed image as a PNG file with the ability to preview the result against different background colors.
