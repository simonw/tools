# Cooking Timer

Set up interactive cooking timers by loading recipe instructions in JSON format, either by pasting directly or providing a URL to a remote recipe file. The timer displays the current step with elapsed time, upcoming tasks with countdowns, and a complete timeline of all cooking instructions that update as you progress through the recipe.
