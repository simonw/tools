# Cooking Timer Documentation

Track multiple cooking steps with precise timing and get real-time notifications of what to do next. Load recipes from URLs or paste JSON directly, then start the timer to see elapsed time, current tasks, and upcoming steps in an organized timeline. The app supports cooking multiple recipes simultaneously by merging their steps and color-coding them by recipe, while also saving your previous recipes for quick access on future cooking sessions.
