# Cooking Timer Documentation

Create cooking recipes with detailed step-by-step instructions and automatically track elapsed time and upcoming tasks during meal preparation. Load recipes from URLs or paste JSON directly, save frequently-used recipes for quick access, and optionally cook multiple recipes simultaneously with synchronized timers. The application stores all state in your browser's local storage, allowing you to pause and resume cooking sessions at any time, and includes a QR code transfer feature for continuing your cooking session on a mobile device.
