This page implements a text editing tool that uses Claude's API to identify unnecessary words in written content based on Strunk & White's editing principles. Users paste text into a textarea, select a language model, and click analyze to receive the original text with omittable words highlighted in strikethrough tags. The tool includes features for customizing the system prompt, viewing detailed stream statistics and debugging information, and automatically calculating what percentage of words could be removed.
