This web application analyzes text to identify and highlight words or phrases that can be omitted without changing meaning, following the principle of "omit needless words." Users paste text into a textarea and click "Analyze text" to send it to Claude's API via server-sent events, which streams back the original text with omittable words wrapped in `<del>` tags for visual highlighting. The interface includes a debug panel that displays real-time streaming metrics, parse logs, and buffer state to help monitor the API communication process.
