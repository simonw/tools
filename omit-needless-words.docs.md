# Documentation

Analyze written text to identify words and phrases that can be removed without changing meaning or grammatical correctness. This tool uses Claude to apply the editing principle "Omit needless words" from Strunk & White's classic style guide, marking removable content like filler words, redundant modifiers, and wordy phrases. Choose from multiple Claude models and customize the system prompt to refine the editing criteria for your specific needs.
