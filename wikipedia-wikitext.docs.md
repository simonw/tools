This application allows users to retrieve the raw wikitext source code from Wikipedia articles by entering a Wikipedia URL. The tool validates the URL format, fetches the wikitext content via the Wikipedia API, and displays it in a formatted output panel with a copy-to-clipboard function. The interface includes real-time feedback with error handling, loading states, and a temporary confirmation message when content is successfully copied.
