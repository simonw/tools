This Wikipedia Wikitext Fetcher application enables users to retrieve and view the raw wikitext source code of Wikipedia articles through an intuitive interface. The tool provides real-time autocomplete suggestions as users search for articles or can accept direct Wikipedia URLs, then fetches and displays the wikitext with the ability to copy the content to the clipboard. The application handles URL parsing, API requests to Wikipedia's parse endpoint, and maintains search history through URL parameters for easy sharing and navigation.
