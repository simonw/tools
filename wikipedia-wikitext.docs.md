This tool retrieves the raw wikitext source code from Wikipedia articles by accepting a Wikipedia URL and querying the Wikipedia API. Users can paste any Wikipedia article URL, and the application displays the underlying markup syntax used to format the page, with options to view and copy the source code. The interface includes error handling for invalid URLs, loading indicators during the fetch process, and a copy-to-clipboard feature for convenient extraction of the wikitext content.
