View SVG content being progressively rendered character by character over a specified duration. Paste an SVG file into the input field, set the animation duration in seconds, and click Render to watch the image draw itself incrementally while the live editor displays the growing SVG code. The tool automatically completes partial SVG markup to ensure valid rendering at each animation step.
