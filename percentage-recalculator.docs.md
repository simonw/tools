Calculate and rescale percentage values in real time with this interactive tool. Enter up to four percentages and optionally mark any as ignored to exclude them from the recalculation, which automatically normalizes the remaining active percentages to sum to 100%. The interface displays both the original values and their recalculated equivalents, making it useful for adjusting weighted distributions or normalizing survey responses.
