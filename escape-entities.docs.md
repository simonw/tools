This HTML Entity Escaper tool converts between special characters and their HTML entity representations in both directions. Users can select between Escape mode, which converts characters like `<`, `>`, and `&` into their entity equivalents for safe display in web pages, or Unescape mode, which decodes HTML entities back into readable characters. The tool supports named entities (such as `&amp;`), decimal numeric entities (such as `&#34;`), and hexadecimal numeric entities (such as `&#x22;`), with real-time conversion as users type and a convenient copy-to-clipboard button for the output.
