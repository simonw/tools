This tool enables users to upload images and send them to various Gemini AI models with custom prompts to extract spatial data such as bounding boxes or point coordinates. The application automatically visualizes the returned coordinates by overlaying them on the original image with a numbered grid system, color-coded boxes or points, and axis labels for reference. It supports multiple model variants and intelligently parses AI responses in both bounding box and point-based formats, automatically adjusting the prompt template based on the selected model.
