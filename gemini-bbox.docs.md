This page provides an interactive tool for analyzing images using the Gemini API and visualizing detected objects as bounding boxes with gridlines. Users can upload an image, enter a custom prompt or select from preset prompts for different AI models, and the application displays the results as overlaid bounding boxes on a coordinate grid alongside extracted region images. The tool stores the API key locally for convenience and supports multiple Gemini model variants for different use cases such as object detection or point-based item identification.
