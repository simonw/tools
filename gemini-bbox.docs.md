This application integrates the Gemini API to analyze images and extract bounding box coordinates, which are then visualized on the original image with a grid overlay and coordinate axes. Users can upload an image, enter a custom prompt requesting bounding box coordinates in `[ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]` format, and select from multiple Gemini model versions to process the request. The extracted coordinates are automatically drawn as colored rectangles on the canvas, and individual cropped regions corresponding to each bounding box are displayed below for easy reference.
