Generate FFmpeg crop commands by uploading a video file and interactively defining a crop area using a draggable overlay. The tool provides both standard and iPhone-compatible FFmpeg command formats that automatically update as you adjust the crop box dimensions and position. This eliminates the need to manually calculate crop parameters for video editing workflows.
