This FFmpeg video crop tool provides an interactive interface for defining crop regions on uploaded videos. Users can upload a video file and manipulate a draggable, resizable crop box overlay to select the desired area, with the interface automatically generating corresponding FFmpeg commands for both standard output and iPhone-compatible encoding. The tool supports both mouse and touch interactions, making it accessible across desktop and mobile devices while maintaining real-time updates to the crop dimensions and generated commands.
