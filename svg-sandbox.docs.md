Embed SVG images directly into HTML using base64 data URIs, which eliminates the need for separate image files and reduces HTTP requests. This demo showcases three different SVG examples encoded in base64 format and displayed through standard image tags, with included JavaScript that safely decodes and displays the underlying SVG source code. When SVGs are embedded this way as images, any potentially unsafe JavaScript or interactive elements within them are automatically ignored by the browser, providing a secure method for inline image delivery.
