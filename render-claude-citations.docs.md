Render Claude API responses with proper citation formatting by pasting JSON output into this tool. The tool parses the response structure and displays text content alongside blockquote-formatted citations, making it easy to review how Claude has sourced and attributed information. An embedded iframe renderer safely displays the formatted output with styling that highlights cited passages.
