# Mobile Data Tables: Responsive Patterns Demo

Explore interactive demonstrations of responsive table design patterns for mobile and narrow screens. This comprehensive guide covers twelve techniques—from horizontal scrolling and pinned columns to stacked cards, column toggling, accordion rows, container queries, comparison modes, and grid-based layouts—each with working code, accessibility features, and real-world use cases. Resize your browser or view on mobile to see how each pattern adapts to different viewport widths, and discover when to use each approach based on your data structure and user needs.
