This page converts terminal output into shareable HTML documents by processing clipboard content in multiple formats including RTF (with color information), HTML, and plain text. Users paste terminal output, and the tool automatically generates both the HTML code and a live preview, with options to copy the code or save it as a GitHub Gist. The application supports authentication with GitHub to enable persistent gist storage with public or private sharing options.
