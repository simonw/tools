This tool converts terminal output in multiple formats (RTF, HTML, and plain text) into standalone HTML documents. Users paste their terminal output, and the application parses the content while preserving colors and formatting, then displays both the generated HTML code and a live preview. The tool also supports saving converted output as GitHub Gists for easy sharing.
