This tool converts terminal output in various formats (RTF, HTML, or plain text) into standalone HTML documents. Users paste their terminal output, and the application automatically detects the format, preserves colors and formatting, and generates both an HTML code preview and a rendered preview. The tool includes options to copy the generated HTML or save it as a GitHub Gist for easy sharing.
