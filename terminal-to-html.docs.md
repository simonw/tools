This tool converts terminal output from the clipboard into HTML format, supporting multiple input formats including RTF (colored terminal output), HTML, and plain text. After pasting terminal output, users receive both the generated HTML code ready to copy and a live preview of how it will appear. The application includes optional GitHub integration that allows users to save the converted output directly to GitHub Gists as either public or private files.
