# Tacopy Playground Documentation

The Tacopy Playground is an interactive web-based tool that demonstrates tail-call optimization for Python by transforming tail-recursive functions into iterative equivalents. Users can input Python code containing tail-recursive functions in the left panel and view the optimized transformed code in the right panel in real-time, with immediate feedback on whether the function is properly tail-recursive. The interface includes pre-built examples such as factorial, Fibonacci, and GCD calculations to help users understand which recursive patterns can be optimized.
