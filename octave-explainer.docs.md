This interactive educational page explores the octave, a fundamental musical interval where one frequency is exactly double another. Users can play notes on an interactive piano keyboard, listen to individual frequencies or octave pairs, and use a slider to experiment with the 2:1 frequency ratio across the audio spectrum. The page includes real-time waveform visualization and playback controls that demonstrate how octaves maintain the same perceived note quality despite their frequency difference.
