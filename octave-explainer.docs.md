This interactive educational page explains the musical concept of an octave through visual and audio demonstrations. Users can explore the fundamental 2:1 frequency relationship by playing an interactive piano, listening to individual frequencies or octave pairs, and adjusting a slider to experiment with any base frequency and its octave equivalent. The page includes real-time waveform visualization, ratio demonstrations, and multiple playable audio examples to reinforce how octaves represent the same musical note at different pitch levels.
