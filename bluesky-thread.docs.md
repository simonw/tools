This application fetches and displays Bluesky threads in a hierarchical, color-coded format. Users input a Bluesky post URL, which the tool resolves to retrieve the full thread conversation using the Bluesky public API, then renders each post with color-coded depth indicators to visualize the reply structure. The interface includes options to copy the thread as formatted text or as raw JSON data, and supports URL parameters for direct thread sharing.
