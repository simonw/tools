This application fetches and displays Bluesky threads in two different viewing modes: a nested thread view that preserves conversation hierarchy with color-coded depth indicators, and a chronological view sorted by most recent posts first. Users can input a Bluesky post URL to retrieve the complete thread from the public API, then copy the thread as formatted text or raw JSON data. The page automatically preserves the viewing preference and post URL in the browser's query parameters for easy sharing and bookmarking.
