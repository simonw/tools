This Bluesky Thread Viewer application fetches and displays threaded conversations from Bluesky posts using the public API. Users can input a Bluesky post URL to view the complete thread with nested replies, rendered with color-coded depth indicators. The tool offers multiple viewing modes including a traditional thread view and a chronological "most recent first" view, with options to copy the thread as formatted text or raw JSON data.
