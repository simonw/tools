This Bluesky Thread Viewer is an interactive web application that fetches and displays conversation threads from Bluesky posts. Users can input a post URL and view the entire threaded conversation with color-coded nesting levels, image galleries, video playback, quoted posts, and external link previews. The application offers multiple viewing modes including a hierarchical thread view and a reverse-chronological view, with the ability to hide non-author replies for easier navigation of multi-threaded discussions.
