# Documentation

This Bluesky Thread Viewer application fetches and displays threaded conversations from Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform. Users input a Bluesky post URL, and the application retrieves the complete thread using the Bluesky API, rendering it with visual depth indicators and support for rich media like images, links, and quoted posts. The viewer offers multiple display modes including a nested thread view and a chronological view sorted by most recent first, with the ability to filter to show only the thread author's posts while hiding other replies.
