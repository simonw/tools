This Bluesky Thread Viewer application fetches and displays threaded conversations from Bluesky using the public API. Users input a Bluesky post URL, which the application converts to an AT protocol URI and retrieves the full thread with up to 1000 levels of depth. The tool provides two viewing modes: a nested thread view that shows replies indented by depth with color-coded stripes, and a chronological view that displays all posts sorted by date with clickable links to parent posts.
