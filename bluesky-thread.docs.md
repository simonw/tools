This Bluesky thread viewer application fetches and displays threaded conversations from Bluesky posts using the public API. It supports two viewing modes: a nested thread view that shows the hierarchical structure of replies, and a chronological view that displays posts in reverse-chronological order with links back to parent posts. The application includes features for viewing embedded images in a modal, rendering quoted posts, external link previews, and copying thread content in both plain text and JSON formats.
