This Bluesky Thread Viewer allows users to fetch and display threaded conversations from Bluesky by entering a post URL. The application supports multiple viewing modes including a nested thread view and a reverse chronological view, while providing features like text copying, facet rendering for links and mentions, and full media support including images, videos, and quoted posts. The thread hierarchy is visually represented through color-coded depth indicators, with special handling for self-replies by thread authors that are displayed as a continuous chain rather than nested branches.
