# Bluesky Search Documentation

This application provides a web interface for searching posts on Bluesky, the decentralized social network. Users must authenticate with their Bluesky handle and app password to access the search functionality, which integrates with the official Bluesky API to retrieve posts based on various criteria. The application supports basic keyword searches as well as advanced filtering options including date ranges, specific authors, mentions, language, linked domains, and hashtags, with results displayable in chronological or popularity order.
