Test and explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in a sandboxed iframe environment with configurable security restrictions. The left panel provides a code editor for writing HTML content, while the right panel displays a live preview with customizable sandbox attributes that control what the iframe can access and execute. Use the checkboxes to enable or disable specific permissions like scripts, forms, popups, and same-origin access to understand how sandbox restrictions affect web content behavior.
