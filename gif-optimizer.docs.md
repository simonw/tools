Optimize animated GIF files using gifsicle compiled to WebAssembly, with all processing occurring directly in your browser without server uploads. The application offers preset optimization profiles ranging from lossless compression to aggressive lossy reduction, along with manual control over parameters like color palette size, scaling, and dithering methods. Each optimization generates a preview and displays the resulting file size reduction, allowing you to compare multiple compression strategies before downloading your preferred version.
