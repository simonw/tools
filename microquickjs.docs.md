Execute JavaScript code in a minimal MicroQuickJS sandbox running via WebAssembly, with results displayed directly in your browser. The code editor supports URL-based sharing through hash fragments and includes ten example programs demonstrating common JavaScript patterns like recursion, array methods, and string manipulation. MicroQuickJS is an ES5-like engine without modern features like async/await or console.log, requiring code to return a value to produce output, though a custom fetch function is available for retrieving external text content.
