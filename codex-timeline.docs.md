View Mozilla Codex rollout timeline events by uploading or pasting a JSONL file to explore the sequence of messages, function calls, and system events with interactive filtering and search capabilities. Each event displays its timestamp in your local timezone or UTC, with detailed views showing formatted content, tool parameters, and reasoning blocks for supported event types. Use the timeline filters to narrow results by event type, payload kind, or message role, and export specific events or concatenate user prompts for external analysis.
