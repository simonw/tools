# Codex Timeline Viewer

Explore Mozilla Codex rollout events through an interactive timeline with powerful filtering and search capabilities. Load a `.jsonl` file via drag-and-drop, file picker, text paste, or URL fetch to visualize the sequence of events, view detailed JSON payloads, and navigate through timestamped entries. The viewer automatically groups events by day, supports local and UTC timezone display, and includes filters for event type, payload kind, and message role to help you focus on relevant data.
