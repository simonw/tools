Explore Codex rollout timeline data with an interactive viewer that parses `.jsonl` files and displays events in a searchable, filterable interface. Load files via drag-and-drop, file picker, paste, or URL, then browse events organized by day with detailed filtering by type, payload kind, and role. Select individual events to inspect their full JSON representation, view associated images, and copy data to your clipboard.
