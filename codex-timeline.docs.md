View Codex rollout timeline data with an interactive event explorer powered by JSONL file parsing. Load files via drag-and-drop, paste, or URL fetch, then filter and search across thousands of timestamped events with detailed JSON inspection for each selected entry. The tool preserves your timezone preference, filter selections, and event choices through shareable URL parameters while displaying payload content, images, and contextual metadata in a responsive side panel.
