# Documentation

This page provides an interactive tool for exploring version history and comparing changes in PyPI packages. Enter any package name to view all available versions with wheel distributions, then click between any two versions to view a detailed diff of the code changes. The tool downloads and extracts wheel files from PyPI to compare file contents, intelligently handling file renames (particularly for `.dist-info` metadata directories) and displaying changes in a syntax-highlighted format.
