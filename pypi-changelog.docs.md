This page provides a tool for exploring PyPI package version histories and comparing changes between releases. Users can enter a package name to view all available versions with wheel distributions and generate detailed diffs between any two versions by downloading and comparing the wheel contents. The application supports sharing specific comparisons via URL parameters and displays differences in a formatted, easy-to-read side-by-side view.
