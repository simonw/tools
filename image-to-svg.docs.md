Convert raster images to scalable vector graphics using automated tracing technology. Upload a JPG or PNG image by dragging it onto the drop zone or clicking to browse, and the application will generate an SVG representation that can be viewed and copied. The conversion process uses imagetracerjs to intelligently trace image edges and create vector paths suitable for scaling to any size without quality loss.
