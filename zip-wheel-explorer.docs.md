This tool enables users to explore the contents of Python packages and archive files by providing either a PyPI package name or a direct URL to a .whl or .zip file. Upon submission, the application automatically locates the corresponding wheel file from PyPI (if a package name is provided), downloads it, and displays an interactive file listing with the ability to preview individual file contents. Query parameters allow users to share pre-populated searches, such as `?package=llm-mistral`, for convenient access to specific packages.
