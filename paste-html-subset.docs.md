This tool converts rich text into a clean HTML subset by letting you paste formatted content from any source. Paste text into the editable area to generate sanitized HTML code that only includes supported elements like paragraphs, headings, links, lists, and preformatted blocks. The tool provides both a code view of the resulting HTML and a live preview window to verify the output appearance.
