Modify text indentation by adding or removing leading spaces from each line, or format text with quotation markers. The tool offers multiple options including indenting by 2 or 4 spaces, removing specific indentation levels, and toggling quote prefixes on all lines. An unquote button automatically appears when all non-empty lines are quoted, providing a convenient way to reverse the formatting.
