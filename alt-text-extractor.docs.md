Extract alternative text and image URLs from rich text content pasted into this tool. Simply paste content from web pages, and the tool automatically detects embedded images, displays them alongside their alt text descriptions, and provides copy buttons for convenient access to both the alt text and image URLs. This utility is particularly useful for accessibility audits, content analysis, and archiving image metadata.
