Capture images from your device's camera and generate haiku poetry inspired by what you photograph using Claude's vision capabilities. Press the camera button to take a photo, and the AI will compose an original haiku based on the image content. The app stores your Anthropic API key locally for convenience and supports switching between front and rear-facing cameras on devices with multiple camera options.
