Extract a subset of Swagger/OpenAPI definitions by selecting specific API endpoints and their dependencies. This tool parses a Swagger JSON document, displays all available paths and methods in an interactive checklist, and generates a filtered JSON output containing only the selected endpoints along with any referenced schema definitions they require. The generated subset can be copied to the clipboard for use in other applications or documentation.
