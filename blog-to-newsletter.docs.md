Transform blog content into a formatted newsletter for Substack by querying the Datasette backup of simonwillison.net and organizing entries, blogmarks, quotations, and TILs. The tool allows you to customize the newsletter by selecting a date range, filtering previously sent content, and reordering stories through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Generated HTML can be copied directly to Substack, with URL length warnings and previous link tracking to prevent duplicate content.
