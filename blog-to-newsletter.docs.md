Convert blog posts and other content from Simon Willison's website into a formatted HTML newsletter ready for Substack distribution. The tool fetches recent entries, blogmarks, quotations, and TILs from a Datasette backup, allows customization of the time period and content filtering, and provides drag-and-drop reordering of stories. Users can copy the generated HTML directly to their newsletter platform while optionally excluding previously sent links and content that appears after a cutoff marker.
