Convert blog content from a Datasette backup into HTML formatted for Substack newsletters. This tool fetches recent entries, blogmarks, quotations, TILs, and notes from simonwillison.net, filters out previously sent content, and provides live preview with drag-and-drop reordering of articles. Users can customize the time range, adjust URLs, and copy the final newsletter HTML directly to their clipboard for pasting into Substack.
