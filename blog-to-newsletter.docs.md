# Blog to Newsletter Documentation

Generate a formatted HTML newsletter from Simon Willison's blog content by fetching posts, links, quotations, and TILs from a Datasette backup of simonwillison.net. The tool allows you to customize the newsletter by selecting a date range, reordering content through drag-and-drop, filtering previously sent items, and copying the result as rich text or HTML directly to your clipboard for pasting into Substack. Long URLs are automatically detected and can be edited before publishing to avoid truncation issues in email clients.
