This tool converts SVG images to JPEG or PNG format with customizable output settings. Users can paste SVG code directly, upload an SVG file, or drag and drop SVG content into the designated area. The conversion supports options for output width, padding, background color selection, and transparency, with real-time preview updates and the ability to download the converted image or copy the base64-encoded image tag for embedding.
