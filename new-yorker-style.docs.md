This tool converts plain text into The New Yorker's distinctive typographic style by applying diacritical marks to words like "coöperate" and "naïve," replacing straight quotes with curly quotation marks, converting double hyphens to em dashes, and transforming ellipses into proper Unicode characters. Users input text in the left panel, and the styled output appears in real-time on the right, with a convenient copy button to transfer the refined text to their clipboard. The design mimics classic New Yorker aesthetics with elegant serif typography and traditional editorial formatting.
