Generate an animated word cloud visualization that displays the real-time placement algorithm as words are positioned on a canvas. The application uses an Archimedean spiral positioning strategy combined with spatial grid-based collision detection to find optimal placement for each word, with the animation showing probe attempts, successful placements, and skipped words. Users can control playback speed, manually step through frames, and download the final result as a PNG image.
