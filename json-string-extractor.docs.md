This tool extracts and displays strings from JSON that are either longer than 20 characters or contain newlines. Paste your JSON into the input field, load the example JSON, or load a JSON file from a GitHub Gist. The tool will automatically identify matching strings and display them with their path information. Each extracted string can be individually copied to the clipboard using the provided copy buttons.

The "Load Gist" button allows you to provide a GitHub Gist URL or ID to load JSON data. You can also share a specific Gist by using `#gist=gist-id` in the URL, which will automatically load that Gist when the page opens.
