This tool extracts and displays strings from JSON that are either longer than 20 characters or contain newlines. The tool will automatically identify matching strings and display them with their path information. Each extracted string can be individually copied to the clipboard using the provided copy buttons.

You can provide JSON in three ways: paste it directly into the input field, load the example JSON, or load a JSON file from a GitHub Gist using the "Load Gist" button. When you load a Gist, you can provide either the full Gist URL or just the Gist ID. 

You can also share a specific Gist by using `#gist=gist-id` in the URL, which will automatically load that Gist when the page opens.
