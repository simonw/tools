# Red Annotation Extractor Documentation

Extract red annotations from AI-generated annotated images and overlay them onto your original photos. This tool isolates red markings (circles, arrows, highlights, text) from images created by AI services like ChatGPT, Gemini, or similar platforms, then optionally applies them to your unmodified original image. The red sensitivity slider allows you to control which shades of red are detected, making it easy to capture all annotation colors while maintaining transparency elsewhere in the image.
