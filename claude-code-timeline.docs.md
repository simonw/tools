View Claude Code session files as an interactive timeline to explore conversations and tool usage chronologically. Load a `.jsonl` file from your local filesystem or a CORS-enabled URL, then filter and search through events by type, content, role, and custom queries. The viewer displays formatted message content, tool calls and results, images, and thinking blocks alongside raw JSON data for each event.
