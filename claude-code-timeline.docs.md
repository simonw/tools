View Claude Code session `.jsonl` files as an interactive timeline explorer. This tool allows you to load session files from `~/.claude/projects/`, search and filter events by type or content, and examine detailed message histories with rendered markdown, tool calls, and embedded images. Times display in your local timezone by default, and you can share explorations via URL parameters.
